# Dashboard UI Rules

## UX mindset — think before building

Before writing any dashboard UI, ask yourself:

1. **What does this person need to DO right now?** Show only that. A supplier opening the calendar needs to see today's sessions and create new ones — not a tutorial about how calendars work.
2. **What can be removed?** If removing an element doesn't make the page harder to use, remove it. Fewer elements = less confusion.
3. **Would a supplier understand this in 2 seconds?** If they need to read a subtitle to understand a section, the section title or content is unclear — fix that instead of adding explanatory text.
4. **Layout hierarcy** Think what the user must see first, second, third... and what they do not have to see at all.

## Layout consistency

- **Forms:** Label above input. Full-width inputs by default. Side-by-side only when fields are related and short (e.g., start time + end time).
- **Action buttons:** Right-aligned. Primary action on the right, secondary on the left.
- **Page structure:** `container max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-6`. Consistent on every page.
- **Cards:** All cards on a page use the same padding, same border style, same radius.
- **Consistent patterns across pages:** If booking management uses a card with "title + meta row + actions", every similar card elsewhere uses the same layout.

## Core principles

1. **Unified surface** — everything on same warm white background. Borders create distinction, **never** shadows or background color variation.
2. **Icons only** — Lucide (`lucide-react`). **Never** emojis.
3. **Visual over text** — badges, status dots, and color communicate state. Text only when essential.

## Anti-patterns — never do these

- Shadows for card distinction (use `border border-border`)
- Different background colors to separate areas (unified surface)
- Equal button padding (use 1.5:1 horizontal:vertical ratio)
- Always-visible helper text (use hover tooltips or placeholder text)
- Text labels where a visual indicator suffices
- Slow transitions on buttons/hovers (use `transition-ui` for 20ms feedback)
- Adding "are you sure?" confirmations for non-destructive actions

## Quick reference

- **Spacing:** 8px grid — `gap-2` (8px), `gap-3` (12px), `gap-4` (16px). No arbitrary values.
- **Border radius:** `rounded-sm` buttons → `rounded` cards → `rounded-md` floating → `rounded-lg` modals → `rounded-full` pills.
- **Status colors:** Use semantic tokens (`bg-success/10 text-success`, `bg-warning/10 text-warning`, etc.), not raw hex values.

## Design docs — read these for component specs and brand details

- `docs/design/dashboard-design-principles.md` — full component spec (sizes, padding, colors, all Tailwind classes, form layout, text rules)
- `docs/design/brand-essence.md` — color palette, typography weights, brand identity, tone of voice
