# Traverum Vision

## What we're building

White-label booking infrastructure that makes local experiences bookable through hotels. Three parties, one platform:

- **Suppliers** (tour operators, activity providers) create experiences and manage bookings. They gain hotel guests as customers without marketing costs.
- **Hotels** embed a branded widget on their website. They earn commission on every booking without operating experiences.
- **Guests** browse and book local experiences through their hotel's website. It feels like a hotel service, not a third-party marketplace.

## Core promise

**For hotels:** Zero effort. Embed a widget, earn commission, enhance guest experience.
**For suppliers:** Access hotel guests. No marketing. Get paid after delivery.
**For guests:** Trusted local experiences. Book through the hotel. Simple and beautiful.

## What must always be true

1. **The guest books through the hotel, not through Traverum.** The widget is white-labeled. Traverum is invisible infrastructure.
2. **Two booking paths.** Session-based (instant) for scheduled experiences. Request-based (approval) for custom times and rentals. Both end in payment.
3. **Supplier is protected.** Guest contact info hidden until payment. Deadlines create urgency. Auto-complete ensures suppliers get paid.
4. **Every flow ends in a commission split.** Supplier + hotel + platform = 100%. This is the business model.
5. **Design = effortlessly warm, quietly precise.** Nordic structure (sisu) + Italian warmth (sprezzatura). Never cold, never ornate.

## North star change detection

**IMPORTANT:** When implementing changes that affect any of the following, STOP and tell the user:
- Booking flow behavior (status transitions, timing windows, payment flow)
- Commission split logic or revenue distribution
- Privacy rules (when guest info is revealed)
- Core entity relationships (partners, experiences, sessions, reservations, bookings)

Say: *"This change affects a north star (booking flow / vision). Should I update `docs/purpose/booking-flow.md` or the relevant cursor rule?"*

## Purpose docs contract

Purpose docs live in `docs/purpose/`. Each has a **Purpose** section (human-owned) and **Key decisions** section.

- **Before editing a page or system**, check for a matching purpose doc. Read it.
- **Never modify the Purpose section** without explicit user approval.
- **Key decisions** can be updated as implementation evolves, but flag changes that contradict the Purpose.
- **After significant changes**, ask: *"Should I update the Key Decisions in [doc]?"*
