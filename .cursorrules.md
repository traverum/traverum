You are building Traverum, a white-label booking platform.

Key principles:
- All prices in cents, display in EUR
- All details in European standards
- no emojies, no icons
- minimalistic, nordic design, as few words as possible

When writing code:
- Supabase Edge Functions for backend logic

Context:
- in traverum-context you find our goal - what problem traverum solves
- in booking-flow-specs you can find specifications of what we want the user flow to be
- in tarverum-widget-demo you can find mock up of the widget, made with Lovable - we like the mock up and we want to use that as a reference
