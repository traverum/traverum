# Traverum Monorepo

## Project Overview
Traverum is a white-label booking platform that transforms hotels into "Destination Hubs" by enabling them to sell local experiences.

## Repository Structure
- apps/widget - Next.js 14 customer-facing booking widget (book.traverum.com)
- apps/dashboard - Vite+React supplier dashboard (dashboard.traverum.com)  
- packages/shared - Shared TypeScript types and utilities

## Tech Stack
- Payments: Stripe Connect
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## Key Conventions
- All prices in cents, display as EUR (€)
- UUIDs for primary keys
- Booking ref format: TRV-XXXXXX
- European dates: DD/MM/YYYY
- 24-hour time format

## Design System
- Primary: Teal #0D9488
- Font: Poppins
- Style: Professional SaaS, shadcn/ui components

## Vercel Deployment (CRITICAL)
There are TWO separate Vercel projects. NEVER mix them up.

| Project | App | Framework | Root Directory | Domain |
|---------|-----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Dashboard** | apps/dashboard | Vite (React) | `apps/dashboard` | dashboard.traverum.com |
| **Widget** | apps/widget | Next.js 14 | `apps/widget` | book.traverum.com |

- Dashboard vercel.json lives in `apps/dashboard/vercel.json`
- Widget vercel.json lives in `apps/widget/vercel.json`
- NEVER deploy the widget to the dashboard Vercel project or vice versa
- Dashboard has NO Next.js dependency — if you see Next.js errors on dashboard, the wrong app is deployed

## When Editing
- Keep Supabase types in sync across apps via @traverum/shared
- Widget handles customer booking flow
- Dashboard handles supplier and hotel management
- Both share same Supabase project
