# Traverum Design Principles

## Philosophy: Sprezzatura Meets Sisu

Two words define everything we build.

**Sisu** — Finnish quiet determination. Functional precision, no-nonsense reliability, nothing unnecessary. This is our structure, our bones.

**Sprezzatura** — Italian effortless elegance. Making the complex look easy and beautiful without appearing to try. This is our soul, our warmth.

Together: *effortlessly warm, quietly precise.*

## Core Principles

### Nothing Unnecessary, Everything Functional

Remove everything that doesn't serve a function. Hide complexity until needed. Show only what's relevant now. Every element, every word, every pixel must justify its existence.

### Visual Over Text

Users see, not read. Visual indicators — badges, icons, colors — communicate state before text does. Text appears only when essential or on hover. Every word must earn its space.

### Warmth, Never Coldness

We are warm ivory, olive accent, natural depth. The warmth makes us feel human — Mediterranean, not sterile. But the warmth is *controlled*, never ornate. The tension between warmth and restraint is the entire point.

### Confident but Quiet

We don't shout. Short, warm sentences. No corporate jargon. A hint of pleasure — travel can be enjoyable. Quality speaks for itself.

### Human Pace

Ambient motion is slow and organic. Functional feedback is instant. Both are deliberate.

### Predictive, Not Prescriptive

Show what users need before they ask. We don't over-guide — we anticipate.

## The Recipe

```
NORDIC (the bones)              ITALIAN (the soul)
─────────────────               ──────────────────
Finlandica font                 Warm ivory backgrounds
Clean structure                 Olive + walnut accents
Functional minimalism           Golden hour warmth
Direct, honest copy             Unhurried pacing
Lots of whitespace              The whitespace feels relaxed, not empty
Reliability signals             Fatto bene — quiet craftsmanship
```

## Color Palette

Every color is warm and muted. No bright, saturated accents. The entire palette feels like it was mixed from the same earth pigments — olive, sage, walnut, terracotta, gold. Old money. Italian villa. Nordic timber.

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Background (brand) | Warm ivory | `#F4EFE6` |
| Background (app) | Warm white | `#FEFCF9` |
| Primary | Olive green | `#5A6B4E` |
| Depth | Walnut brown | `#5D4631` |
| Neutral | Warm slate | `#6B7280` |
| Success | Muted sage | `#6B8E6B` |
| Warning | Muted gold | `#C9A961` |
| Error | Muted terracotta | `#B8866B` |
| Info | Muted blue-gray | `#7A9CC6` |
| Text | Warm gray | `rgb(55, 53, 47)` |
| Text muted | Warm gray | `rgba(55, 53, 47, 0.4)` |
| Borders | Warm gray | `rgba(55, 53, 47, 0.09)` |

**Olive** is the Traverum color. Italian countryside and Nordic forest at once. Grounded, timeless, never trendy.

## Typography

**Font:** Finlandica — our Nordic skeleton. Clean, functional, Finnish.

| Context | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| Headlines | 300 (light) |
| Body | 300 (light) |
| Labels / emphasis | 500 (medium) |

## What to Avoid

- Cold white backgrounds
- Bright saturated colors
- Aggressive copy or superlatives
- Corporate jargon
- Emojis
- Italian cliches: flags, Roman columns, "Ciao!", stock photos of Italy
- Ornate warmth that loses Nordic credibility

## The Test

Even an Italian nonna understands what our pages are for.
Even a Finnish top designer loves how they look.

Simple yet effective. Reliable like sisu. Effortless and warm as sprezzatura.

That's Traverum.
